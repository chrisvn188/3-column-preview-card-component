## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Apply flexbox faster to build one dimensional layout.

- I don't know why when I use border for element it's gonna take up space but outline is better solution for this project
